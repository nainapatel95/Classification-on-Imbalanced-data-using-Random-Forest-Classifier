Classification on Imbalanced Data: Insurance Claims
Introduction
In the field of machine learning and data science, dealing with imbalanced data is a common yet critical challenge. Imbalanced data occurs when the classes within a dataset are not represented equally. This is particularly problematic in classification tasks, where the minority class (the class with fewer instances) can be overshadowed by the majority class, leading to biased predictions. In this project, we address the issue of imbalanced data using a dataset of insurance claims.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of insurance claims based on various features of policyholders and their vehicles. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with significantly more non-claim instances than claim instances. We employ several techniques to handle this imbalance and build robust classification models.

*Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to policyholders and their vehicles, including:

1. policy_id: Unique identifier for the insurance policy
subscription_length: Length of the insurance subscription
customer_age: Age of the customer
vehicle_age: Age of the vehicle
region_density: Population density of the region
region_code: Code representing the region
model: Model of the vehicle
engine_type: Type of engine in the vehicle
gross_weight: Gross weight of the vehicle
length: Length of the vehicle
claim_status: Whether a claim was made or not (target variable)
Methodology
Handling Imbalanced Data
To tackle the issue of imbalanced data, we use several techniques:

Resampling Methods:

Oversampling: We use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.

We use ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers, which can handle class imbalance effectively.

* Model Training and Evaluation
We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our models. The key steps include:

* Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.
* Model Training: Training classification models using the processed data.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to ensure a balanced performance across all classes.
*Feature Importance:
To understand which features are most influential in predicting insurance claims, we analyze feature importance using the Random Forest model. This helps in identifying and focusing on the most significant variables.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates effective strategies to handle imbalanced data in a classification problem. By applying these techniques to an insurance claims dataset, we build models that can predict claims accurately, ensuring that the minority class is adequately represented. The methods and findings from this project can be applied to other imbalanced datasets across various domains.
